## Stability

The latest version is a Beta release, which means all these APIs can change over a short period of time without prior notice

So, please be aware that this is plugin is not intended for production usage yet, since the API is currently in development.

## Installation

```
flutter pub add shared_storage
```

or

```
dependencies:
  shared_storage: ^latest # Pickup the latest version either from the pub.dev page or the badge in this README.md
```

## Plugin

This plugin include **partial** support for the following APIs:

### Partial Support for [Environment API](/Environment/Usage)

Mirror API from [Environment API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment)

```dart
import 'package:shared_storage/environment.dart' as environment;
```

### Partial Support for [Media Store API](/Media Store/Usage)

Mirror API from [MediaStore provider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore)

```dart
import 'package:shared_storage/media_store.dart' as mediastore;
```

### Partial Support for [Storage Access Framework](/Storage Access Framework/Usage)

Mirror API from [Storage Access Framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider)

```dart
import 'package:shared_storage/saf.dart' as saf;
```

All these APIs are module based, which means they are implemented separadely and so you need to import those you want use.

> To request support for some API that is not currently included open a issue explaining your usecase and the API you want to make available, the same applies for new methods or activities for the current APIs.

## Android APIs

Most Flutter plugins use Android API's under the hood. So this plugin does the same, and to call native Android storage APIs the following API's are being used:

[`ðŸ”—android.os.Environment`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment#summary) [`ðŸ”—android.provider.MediaStore`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore#summary) [`ðŸ”—android.provider.DocumentsProvider`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider)
